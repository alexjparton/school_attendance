# school_attendance

This project cleans and merges data from Open NYC data to visualize chronic absenteeism in NYC public schools. 

The code creates an interactive dashboard for chronic absenteeism over time by demographic category. 

The dashboard is available here: https://alexjparton.shinyapps.io/NYC_chronic_absenteeism_dashboard/

Possible future projects: 
- Map of NYC schools by demographic category and school population
  -- by district
  -- by borough
  -- by school? 
  
Change this real quick.
